Most task managers are centered around, well, tasks. As a researcher and writer, my work often cannot be meaningfully broken into tasks. It is not helpful to put on my todo list "Have a good idea about X tomorrow." It also isn't helpful to have something like "Write 500 words." Some days the words come easy, on others, they don't. Instead, what I want to track is how many projects I currently have, and how many good days work I have done on each of them. Daily Log is a command line app to do just this. It also allows me to display that information in graphical form in the terminal, which is where I'd rather be :)
